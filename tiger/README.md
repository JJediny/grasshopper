# TIGER

Service that geocodes a single address string into a point, using the Census Bureau TIGER ADDRFEAT line segment data set.

## Building

## Running

For development, the project can be run from the `sbt` by typing `re-start`. This will fork a JVM and start the service, which by default requires an Elasticsearch server running on the same machine.
